It has pretty much everything you need, a well-equipped gym, nice rooms with a large window to see the landscape of Singapore, the location is excellent, everything can be reached via walking. Clubs Street and Telok Ayer Street, two very popular roads with plenty of restaurants and cafes are just across the street and the Marina is an easy 8 min walk. The first room I got was quite small but the staff arranged a different room for me which was much more spacious. Again, overall a very satisfying stay at a nice hotel.","There are 3 things I did not like:1. It was extremely difficult to reach the staff, let it be reception, housekeeping or restaurant, it always took multiple times until I reached someone who could answer my request. I always got some unprofessional reply that things are busy etc etc, but honestly for a hotel of this price category and claiming 5 stars this is by far not what I have experienced at other 5 stars hotels. I mentioned this a few times, but I guess my opinion was not really important. However, once I reached the staff they always answered my request and made it happen. 2. The pillows had a very weird smell. I was hoping that the smell of the pillows would go away after the housekeeping changes the sheets but it was still there. Hence I suspect the sheets weren't changed or they use some funky detergent at the hotel. 3. Food comes in paper boxes - I only ordered once and it was simple, scrambled eggs and bread and it was delivered in a paper box for 20 SGD (14 EUR). I would have expected something else from a 5 star hotel - again I suspect it was ordered from somewhere else. Not really a performance I would expect from such an expensive hotel....it might be because the hotel is still new but then guests need to be informed.","The hotel itself is brand-new and very well designed.
